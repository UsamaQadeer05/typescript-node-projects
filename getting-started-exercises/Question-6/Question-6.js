// 6. Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. 
// Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
// Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
var person_name = "\t\tHamza\n\t Shaukhat\n";
console.log(person_name);
console.log(person_name.replace(/[\t\n]/g, ''));
